It is and does exactly what the description said it would be and would do. Couldn't be happier with it.
Very mobile product. Efficient. Easy to use; however product needs a varmint guard. Critters are able to gorge themselves without a guard.
Easy to use a mobile. If you're taller than 4ft, be ready to tuck your legs behind you as you hang and pull.
Love this feeder. Heavy duty & capacity. Best feature is the large varmint guard. Definitely use a small lock or securing device on the battery housing latch. I gave 4 stars because several bolts were missing. Check contents b4 beginning.
Solid, stable mount. Holds iPhone with phone protector well. I have not however used the dash mount part of this product (only windshield).
I bought this pepper because I wanted a lot of cayenne powder I mean a lot. I drink shots of this powder daily and I do like it but I'm not sure if it's just me but it does not seem to strong I sweat for a minute but I feel like it could be stronger I even touched my eyes to see if it would hurt still not feeling much pain. Im one in 7 billion so do forget my review since I'm more hardcore.
Useless  - ALL you need is a Good Diet , and 1 hour cardio everyday , These kind of thigs are useless
Bought this for my daughter and she loves it!  It is also easy to attach the wheels; it's ready to go in under 5 minutes.
I wanted a razor and brush stand that would give off the classy 1920s/30s vibe that seemed to match with using a safety razor. This stand does the job. It fits my razor and brush perfectly, and looks damn good while it does it.
I bought this battery to replace the original battery for my Samsung SGH-I727 Galaxy II Skyrocket, and it works perfectly. I had to remove the sticker for the battery cover to close correctly, but I knew what I was getting myself into before I even bought it. The charge time takes a little longer, as expected, but having the extra battery life is well worth it.
